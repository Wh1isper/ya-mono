# YA Claw Architecture Spec

YA Claw is a workspace-native single-node runtime web service built on top of `ya-agent-sdk`.

This spec set defines one execution shape:

- one runtime service
- one in-process execution supervisor
- one in-process runtime state view for active runs and event delivery
- one SQLite database by default
- optional PostgreSQL for deployments that prefer an external relational store
- one local data root for committed continuity blobs
- one bundled web shell

## Design Principles

- **Single-node first**: one machine, one runtime, one operational context
- **Workspace-root based**: one configured workspace root bounds runtime file and shell access
- **Opaque project selector**: `project_id` is application input that YA Claw consumes and records
- **SDK-aligned**: `ya-agent-sdk` stays responsible for agent execution primitives
- **Queued-run execution model**: API ingress, schedules, and bridges all create durable queued runs before execution starts
- **Explicit runtime assembly**: workspace resolution, environment construction, context construction, and agent runtime construction each have their own boundary
- **Profile-driven configuration**: reusable execution profiles live in the relational store and can be seeded from YAML
- **Durable and practical**: SQLite is the default durable store, PostgreSQL is an optional backend, and the local filesystem stores committed session state

## Out of Scope

- multi-tenant control plane
- distributed worker pools and cross-node scheduling
- runtime-managed project catalogs or project CRUD
- hosted operator portal
- full database schema freeze before implementation
