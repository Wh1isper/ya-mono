This summary covers important details of the historical conversation with the user which has been truncated.
It's crucial that you respond by ONLY asking the user what you should work on next.

Keep this response CONCISE and wrap your analysis in `analysis` and `context` fields to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points.

IMPORTANT: If the message history shows that a Skill was activated and remains relevant to unfinished work, you MUST include a reminder in the context to re-read that Skill's documentation when resuming. A candidate Skill that was merely inspected or rejected was not activated and must not create a re-read requirement.

   [Problems solved and ongoing troubleshooting]

6. Current Work:
   [Precise current work immediately before compaction. If the current user request references numbered items, "above", "that", or similar phrases, resolve those references using the previous assistant response and spell out what they refer to.]

7. Optional Next Step:
   [Direct next step aligned with the current work]

8. Past Interactions:
   - [Key interactions already completed, including actions and outcomes]

   [List only Skills that were activated and remain relevant to unfinished work, and remind the next agent to re-read them. Do not include Skills that were merely inspected or rejected as candidates.]
