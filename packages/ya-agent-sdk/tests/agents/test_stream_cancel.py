"""Tests for stream_agent cancellation behavior.

Verifies that:
1. Cancellation actually stops agent execution (no token waste)
2. A fresh run after cancellation works without ContextVar errors
3. The cleanup does not re-cancel tasks (allowing pydantic-ai's internal
   ContextVar cleanup to complete)
