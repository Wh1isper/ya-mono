# YAACLI CLI

TUI reference implementation for [ya-agent-sdk](https://github.com/wh1isper/ya-mono/tree/main/packages/ya-agent-sdk).

## Usage

Run with uvx:

```bash
uvx --from 'yaacli[rs]' yaacli
```

Install with uv:

```bash
uv tool install 'yaacli[rs]'
yaacli
```

Install a trusted capability plugin into the same isolated tool environment with
`--with`:

```bash
uv tool install 'yaacli[rs]' --with acme-agent-plugin
```

`[rs]` installs the native Rust filesystem search binding. The equivalent extra-dependency form is:

```bash
uv tool install yaacli --with ya-ripgrep-core
```

`ya-ripgrep-core` is a library dependency, so `--with` is the matching uv form; `--with-executables-from` applies to companion packages that also expose CLI executables.

Update with uv:

```bash
uv tool upgrade yaacli
```

## Model Price Updates

YAACLI calls `pydantic_ai.prices.update_in_background()` once when the TUI application
enters, keeps the handle across turns, sessions, and subagent runs, and stops it when
the application exits. Both the direct TUI entrypoint and fast-start execution child
use this boundary; the fast-start terminal parent does not start an updater. Headless
execution owns a handle for the entire invocation, including internal continuations.

The upstream worker downloads immediately and then hourly, without blocking startup.
Failed downloads retain existing prices, and early responses may still be unpriced.
Price updates do not recalculate recorded usage snapshots. Sharing is per process;
a new CLI process downloads again. No per-turn SDK runtime starts a price updater.

For your own SDK application, retain an upstream updater at startup and call `stop()`
at shutdown, or wrap the application in `with prices.update_in_background():`. See
[the SDK guide](../ya-agent-sdk/README.md#keep-model-prices-up-to-date).

## Subagent Configuration

YAACLI accepts both generic Markdown definitions and native versioned `SubagentSpec`
YAML/JSON documents under `~/.yaacli/subagents/`. In the interactive TUI, the visible
`delegate` tool is processor-hosted and fully asynchronous: it immediately returns a
bounded structured result with a readable `<subagent-name>-<4hex>` `execution_id`.
Foreground and background use the same handle format; mode is explicit result data. Use
`resume_subagent(execution_id, prompt)` for linked continuation, and use the returned
execution ID for wait, steering, and cancellation. The one-shot headless frontend fixes
the same processor-hosted tool to foreground mode and returns the same result shape with
a bounded output page before shutdown.

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Review a bounded change and report evidence-based findings.
instruction: Use this agent after meaningful implementation or refactoring.
model: inherit
model_settings: inherit
model_cfg: inherit
tools: [glob, grep, ls, view]
---

You are a senior code reviewer. Prioritize architecture, correctness, security, and
critical-path behavior.
```

Markdown is normalized into the current portable `SubagentSpec`; it does not activate a
legacy runtime. The frontmatter `description` plus optional `instruction` form the
parent-facing delegation roster entry; the Markdown body becomes the child's native
instructions. Omitted or `inherit` model fields use the active root model, settings, and
context configuration. YAACLI materializes its current standard child capability
template for the common inherited-tool behavior, then turns any tool list into a final
visibility allowlist. It does not copy live parent, MCP, plugin, delegation, or
main-agent-only capabilities.

A same-basename Markdown file is the complete authoritative definition. Any native
preset copied by an earlier upgrade is ignored rather than merged, so a stale capability
snapshot cannot override the current standard child template. Other duplicate routes
remain errors. New setup runs do not copy `code-reviewer.yaml` when
`code-reviewer.md` already exists. Use native YAML/JSON by itself when exact capability
grants, plugin types, nesting, or full delegation policy are required. See
[`spec/02-configuration.md`](spec/02-configuration.md) for both schemas.

## Capability Plugins

YAACLI optionally loads the SDK's strict plugin manifest from the fixed global path
`~/.yaacli/plugins.toml`:

```toml
schema_version = 1
entry_points = ["acme.search"]

[[capabilities]]
name = "acme.search"
arguments = { result_limit = 10 }
```

Package installation and authorization are separate. The distribution must be installed
in YAACLI's own Python environment; `entry_points` then selects the exact installed
types YAACLI may import, and `capabilities` grants ordered instances to the main root
agent. YAACLI never scans or loads every installed entry point.

The file is global-only because selected Python code executes with YAACLI process
authority. A project `.yaacli/plugins.toml` is ignored. A missing global file means no
external plugins; invalid TOML, unknown fields, missing or duplicate entry points,
import failures, grant argument signature mismatches, and catalog collisions stop
startup. Manifest arguments are durable non-secret configuration, so secret-like keys
such as API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials are rejected recursively. This
name-based guard cannot detect a secret stored under a neutral key; keep every secret
value outside the manifest.

Selected types are available to native subagent documents, but root grants do not
implicitly enter named children or self forks. A child must declare the selected
serialization name in its own `agent.capabilities`. TUI and headless startup each load
one catalog snapshot and reuse it for current, historical, child, and restored runtime
construction. Restart YAACLI after changing the manifest or installed distribution.

See the SDK [file configuration contract](../ya-agent-sdk/spec/06-capability-plugins/03-file-configuration.md)
and the [installable example](../../examples/capability_plugin/).

Install with pip:

```bash
pip install 'yaacli[rs]'
yaacli
```

Run as a module:

```bash
python -m yaacli
```

## Headless and Saved Sessions

Run one prompt without the TUI:

```bash
yaacli -p "Fix the failing tests"
yaacli -p "Continue" --session <session-id> --profile <profile-id>
yaacli -p "Run an isolated worker task" --worker
```

Headless stdout is an NDJSON event stream. Human-readable diagnostics, fatal details, and resume hints are written to stderr so scripts can parse every stdout line as JSON. Every successful, failed, or cancelled logical run commits a terminal durable revision. `--worker` requires `--prompt` and disables delegate subagents for that run. `--profile` applies only to the current invocation; selecting a profile through `/model` persists it for future launches.

Inspect or delete durable sessions without starting the TUI:

```bash
yaacli sessions list
yaacli sessions show <session-id>
yaacli sessions delete <session-id>
yaacli sessions maintain
```

Session IDs may be supplied by unique prefix. The YAACLI 2 product store defaults to
`~/.yaacli/sessions/sessions-v2.sqlite3`. SQLite contains only transactional metadata
and small coordination records; grep-friendly revision, checkpoint, and child payloads
live beside it under `<session-id>/{revisions,checkpoints,subagents}/<id>/state.json`.
Schema-v5 and other incompatible databases are rejected without runtime migration,
reset, or modification. The former `sessions.sqlite3` is left untouched. An explicit
`[session] database_path` or `YAACLI_DATABASE_PATH` remains authoritative, with state
directories placed next to that database. Run `yaacli sessions maintain` explicitly,
while no other YAACLI process is using that store, to apply retention and storage
maintenance; it is never part of startup. `[session] max_turns_per_session`,
`max_sessions`, and the optional
`max_session_age_days` define its retention limits. Nonterminal main and child work is
never selected for automatic deletion. See
[`spec/05-session-persistence.md`](spec/05-session-persistence.md).

## TUI Interaction

On a configured POSIX TTY, YAACLI immediately renders the canonical editable TUI layout while a cold child process initializes the agent runtime and durable session host. When the child is ready, terminal ownership transfers without leaving and re-entering the alternate screen. Draft text, cursor and selection, send/edit mode, mouse mode, and a locally queued Enter are preserved. A queued prompt is submitted only through the runtime TUI's ordinary durable acceptance path; startup never displays a false acknowledgement or moves initialization cost to the first request. First-time setup, worktree creation, unsupported terminals, non-TTY use, and headless mode retain direct startup.

The output viewport has priority over auxiliary UI. The task pane is hidden when empty, uses one summary row by default, and expands with `F2`. The model selector is an overlay and does not permanently consume output rows.

- Enter submits while idle and sends guidance to the active run while an agent is running.
- Ordinary text submitted during an active agent run is durable steering. YAACLI persists the original text before displaying a replayable `Guidance sent to the active run.` receipt and waking the owning local execution task. The native enqueue boundary applies the established model-facing steering reminder envelope rather than treating the text as a new ordinary prompt; native application later displays a distinct replayable `Guidance injected` projection. Adjacent guidance applied at one graph boundary is grouped into one visible block while retaining distinct durable events, and restored application blocks remain beside their acceptance receipts rather than moving to the bottom. This uses native Pydantic AI enqueue and does not restore MessageBus. Main-run input admission has no ingress or session lock: graph-boundary snapshots, input writes, and terminal commits use SQLite transaction order with last-write-wins semantics. A terminal-winning input is persisted as rejected without raising, is not acknowledged as sent, and leaves the compose draft intact. The status bar counts accepted/enqueued inputs without exposing their content. Registered slash commands and `!shell` remain local control syntax: safe busy commands execute and idle-only commands are rejected without clearing the draft. Other slash-prefixed text, including absolute paths such as `/home/user/file`, remains ordinary user input.
- `/cancel` or `Ctrl+C` requests cancellation of cancellable foreground work, including pending approval and structured-question waits. Cancellation preserves already visible tool calls, including when it lands between a native segment and checkpoint publication. Once the TUI enters `SAVING`, persistence is allowed to finish and cannot be cancelled; Ctrl+C does not exit while the save is in progress.
- `/clear` clears only the visible transcript; `/new` starts a fresh conversation and session. Tombstoning refuses nonterminal main work, closes child input, atomically records nonterminal children as cancelled, and persists cancellation intent; late child success, steering, and completion delivery are fenced while the runtime environment remains reusable.
- Background results never modify or clear the compose area. A terminal background subagent is projected as session-scoped readiness only; its committed result enters the canonical parent continuation path on the next accepting agent turn and does not automatically wake the model. Monitored-shell notifications are persisted as feature input and may start one idle turn according to shell-monitor policy. There is no `/integrate` command or MessageBus delivery path.
- `/agents` shows running and recently completed background subagents; `/process` shows active background shell processes.
- `/attachments` and `/remove-image` inspect or edit images queued for the next turn.
- `/tool <call-id>` shows the complete retained result for a tool call.
- `/session <id>` restores a saved session. The CLI equivalent is `yaacli --session <id>`.
- Use `/help` for the complete built-in and configured command list. Slash commands and available skills complete while typing.
- Prefix an idle prompt with one or more available skill names to request them explicitly: `/lark-cli /agent-builder Build an agent that replies in Lark`. Only the leading consecutive `/skill-name` tokens are selected. Reserved built-in commands keep control-plane precedence; an available skill takes precedence over a configured prompt command with the same name.
- The interactive TUI enables `ask_user_question` by default. When the agent needs clarification, YAACLI renders one to four structured questions and accepts an option number, comma-separated numbers for multi-select questions, or free text.
- Long status text wraps to the available terminal width. When token usage is enabled it shows context utilization, durable cumulative session tokens in decimal K/M/B units, `cache read / all tokens`, and estimated cost. Session usage includes all native continuation segments, including HITL pauses; repeated live updates do not count a segment twice. Cache read/write counters remain details, with `all tokens = input + output`. Controlled failure/cancellation retains safely captured usage; restart recovery retains the last stable checkpoint's totals. Foreground elapsed time uses compact forms such as `42s`, `3m 05s`, and `1h 05m 09s`.

## Built-in Skills

YAACLI ships with `building-agents` from the repository canonical source `skills/agent-builder/`.

The YA Claw deployment skill lives in `skills/ya-claw-deploy/` and is published as `YA_CLAW_DEPLOY_SKILL.zip` during release.

The repository sync script keeps bundled skill files under `packages/yaacli/yaacli/skills/` aligned.

YAACLI refreshes and resolves `/skill-name` against the effective SDK skill catalog at submission time, including built-in, global, shared, and project skills after normal priority rules. Like a configured prompt command, the visible transcript and model input contain one `Use this skill: <name>` line per selected skill followed by the remaining task as `User instructions: <task>`; prompt history retains the original slash input for editing and reuse. A slash prefix that matches neither a registered command nor an available skill is submitted as ordinary user input.

## CodeAct

YAACLI exposes `run_code` and `run_program` by default. They execute restricted Python for tool orchestration; `run_program` reads reviewed programs through the runtime's `FileOperator`. Shell remains a separate execution surface and is not made callable from CodeAct. Disable both CodeAct tools globally in `~/.yaacli/tools.toml` or per project in `.yaacli/tools.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
enable_codeact = false
```

## MCP Tool Exposure

MCP tools are exposed directly to the model by default. Configure the behavior globally in `~/.yaacli/tools.toml` or per project in `.yaacli/tools.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
mcp_mode = "direct" # "direct" (default) or "proxy"
```

Direct mode registers each configured MCP server as a native toolset and exposes namespaced `<server>_<tool>` names by default. A server's optional `prefix` field in `mcp.json` overrides `<server>`; set it to `""` to expose the server's native tool names without a prefix. Omitting `prefix` or setting it to `null` preserves the default server-name prefix. Proxy mode exposes the fixed `mcp_search_tool` and `mcp_call_tool` pair instead, which can improve prompt-cache stability when many MCP tools are configured. Servers marked `"required": false` remain optional in both modes. If an optional server cannot connect or becomes unavailable, the TUI reports the degraded MCP namespace once per status change and continues without that server.

For direct host-managed MCP tools, structured output remains the tool's Python return value even when the response also contains media. Completed MCP error responses are returned for model or CodeAct inspection without consuming Pydantic AI's `ModelRetry` budget; failures that produce no MCP result are terminal failed tool outcomes.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "docs": {
      "transport": "streamable_http",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
      "prefix": "reference"
    },
    "local": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "local-mcp-server",
      "prefix": ""
    }
  }
}
```

## Structured User Input

The interactive TUI opts into the SDK's deferred `ask_user_question` tool. Disable it globally in `~/.yaacli/tools.toml` or for one project in `.yaacli/tools.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
enable_user_input = true
user_input_timeout_seconds = 120
```

`enable_user_input` defaults to `true`. Each structured question waits up to `user_input_timeout_seconds`, which defaults to 120 seconds. If no answer arrives, YAACLI rejects the deferred call with an English model prompt that explains the timeout and directs the agent to continue using its best judgment rather than requesting the same input again. Set `enable_user_input = false` to remove the tool entirely. Headless mode does not expose this tool because it cannot collect interactive answers. The SDK also leaves it disabled unless a host explicitly registers it and implements deferred continuation. Project `tools.toml` replaces the global tool policy as a whole; if a project file exists, repeat any non-default user-input settings there rather than relying on global values.

## Development

This package lives in the [`ya-mono`](https://github.com/wh1isper/ya-mono) workspace.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_NAME/ya-mono.git
cd ya-mono
uv sync --all-packages
cp packages/yaacli/.env.example packages/yaacli/.env
```

YAACLI loads `.env` from `packages/yaacli/.env` and the current working directory without replacing variables already present in the process. The package file is loaded first and therefore wins duplicate keys; the working-directory file supplies only keys that remain unset.
Provider API keys can live in that `.env` file or in `~/.yaacli/config.toml` under `[env]`.
SDK and tool variables such as `YA_AGENT_*` and search API keys can also live in that same `.env` file because YAACLI loads it into the process environment at startup. `YA_AGENT_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` changes the generic tool-execution ceiling from its 600-second default; tool-owned shorter deadlines still apply.
Use [`packages/ya-agent-sdk/.env.example`](../ya-agent-sdk/.env.example) as the reference list for SDK and tool variables.

The TUI selects a light or dark theme at startup. In `auto` mode it uses the passive `COLORFGBG` terminal hint when available, followed by the dark theme. YAACLI does not send active color queries because a delayed terminal response can leak into the compose buffer or the parent shell after exit. Override detection in `~/.yaacli/config.toml` when needed:

```toml
[display]
code_theme = "auto" # auto, dark, or light
```

The equivalent environment override is `YAACLI_CODE_THEME=auto`.

## Terminal Bells

YAACLI emits a terminal bell by default after a successful interactive agent turn and whenever a turn pauses for HITL user input. Either notification can be disabled independently:

```toml
[notifications]
bell_on_turn_complete = false
bell_on_user_action_required = false
```

A run's elapsed timer is paused for the entire HITL wait and resumes after all requested user actions have been answered. The bell is emitted by the terminal, so it passes through SSH and is handled by the local terminal client. In VS Code Remote, configure the local VS Code **User** settings (not Remote or workspace settings) to show the visual bell and always play its terminal-bell accessibility signal:

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.enableVisualBell": true,
  "terminal.integrated.bellDuration": 1000,
  "accessibility.signals.terminalBell": {
    "sound": "on",
    "announcement": "off"
  }
}
```

Use `"sound": "on"` for unconditional playback; `"auto"` lets VS Code decide whether to play the accessibility signal. `announcement` controls screen-reader output and can remain `"auto"` when needed. VS Code plays its own accessibility sound through the local audio output; this is not an operating-system desktop notification.

To verify terminal support independently of YAACLI, run `printf '\a'` in the same integrated terminal. It should show VS Code's visual-bell indicator. Remote YAACLI processes cannot directly invoke the client machine's operating-system notification API.

Codex OAuth credentials can be created once and reused from YAACLI:

```bash
uvx ya-oauth login codex
```

Then set `model = "oauth@codex:gpt-5.5"` in a YAACLI model profile.

Model profiles are configured in `~/.yaacli/config.toml` and selected with `/model` inside the TUI:

```toml
[general]
model = "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5"
model_settings = "anthropic_adaptive_high"
model_cfg = "claude_200k"
instructions = """
Prefer careful analysis and concise answers.
"""

[model_profiles.fast]
label = "Fast"
model = "openai-responses:gpt-5.6-luna"
model_settings = "openai_responses_luna"
model_cfg = "gpt5_270k"
instructions = """
Optimize for speed. Avoid broad exploration unless necessary.
"""

[model_profiles.pro]
label = "GPT-5.6 Pro"
model = "openai-responses:gpt-5.6"
model_settings = "openai_responses_pro"
model_cfg = "gpt5_270k"

[model_profiles.sol]
label = "GPT-5.6 Sol"
model = "openai-responses:gpt-5.6-sol"
model_settings = "openai_responses_max"
model_cfg = "gpt5_270k"

[model_profiles.codex_oauth]
label = "Codex OAuth"
model = "oauth@codex:gpt-5.5"
model_settings = "openai_responses_high"
model_cfg = "gpt5_350k"
```

`instructions` is an optional static model-instruction segment for the active main-agent profile. YAACLI evaluates it for every model request, alongside the built-in prompt (or `general.system_prompt_file`), project guidance, and user rules. Switching profiles with `/model` replaces the active profile instructions for later requests in the same session, including restored or compacted histories.

For context-header model transports, YAACLI binds the main agent's `x-session-id` to the durable session ID. Each named subagent or self fork instead uses its stable root child execution ID for both provider session and thread routing, so its identity differs from the main agent and survives retry or linked continuation. Model configurations with `openai_prompt_cache_key` derive it from that exact main or child `x-session-id` on every request.

YAACLI enables stream recovery by default for every root and subagent profile. Root agents, named subagents, and self forks use the same overall recovery mechanism. Non-transport execution failures use three total attempts, while each consecutive transient HTTP/WebSocket transport-failure streak uses an independent 20-attempt budget that resets after a successful model request. Each child owns its recovery history, usage accounting, and retry budgets. An inline root or child `model_cfg` can override either budget or explicitly set `stream_resume_on_error = false`.

`[general]` is the startup fallback profile. The last selected profile is remembered in `~/.yaacli/state.json` and restored on the next launch when that profile still exists.

Shell command review is configured in `~/.yaacli/config.toml` under `security.shell_review`:

```toml
[security.shell_review]
enabled = true
model = "gateway@openai-responses:gpt-5.4-mini"
model_settings = "openai_responses_low"
on_needs_approval = "defer"
risk_threshold = "high"
```

When enabled, `model` is required. `model_settings` accepts SDK preset names or an inline TOML table. `risk_threshold` defaults to `high` and controls when the configured action triggers.

Run CLI tests from the workspace root:

```bash
make test-cli
```

## Clipboard Image Paste

Plain terminal paste always inserts text into the input box.
Use `Ctrl+V` or `/paste-image` to attach an image from the system clipboard. During an active agent run the image remains queued for the next turn and is never converted into steering text. Generated attachment chips are removed before registered commands, explicit skills, `!` control syntax, or ordinary prompts are classified, so a visible chip cannot hide a command. If the user deleted the chip, its binary is removed before dispatch.
On macOS terminal apps over SSH, map `Command+Shift+V` to send `Ctrl+V` if you want a native-feeling shortcut.

YAACLI reads clipboard images through Pillow first on macOS and Windows.
macOS also reads Finder-copied image files through Cocoa pasteboard APIs via `pyobjc-framework-Cocoa`.
Linux image paste still relies on `wl-paste` on Wayland or `xclip` on X11.
