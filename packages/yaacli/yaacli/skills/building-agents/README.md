# agent-builder

Canonical source for the `agent-builder` skill used by YAACLI.

## Purpose

This directory is the source of truth for the skill bundle that YAACLI ships as `building-agents`.

The sync flow is:

1. edit files in `skills/agent-builder/`
2. run `scripts/sync-skills.sh`
3. bundled files are copied into `packages/yaacli/yaacli/skills/building-agents/`
